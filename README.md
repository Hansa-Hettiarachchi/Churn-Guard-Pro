# Churn-Guard-Pro

For credit card firms, client churn the phenomenon of customers stopping their card services has grown to be a serious problem. It impedes long-term profitability and creates uncertainty about future revenues. This study suggests a data-driven method for machine learning-based customer attrition prediction in order to address this problem. Through the use of both exploratory and descriptive data analysis techniques, a dependable machine learning model is created that can precisely identify clients who are at risk by identifying patterns and relationships within customer data. Using F1 scores, the performance of several machine learning algorithms Random Forest, Ada-Boost, SVM, and XGBoost is assessed; XGBoost performs better than the others. The final model is deployed in a user-friendly Stream lit-based web application, enabling credit card companies to proactively identify and retain highvalue customers. This study advances the tactics used by credit card companies to retain customers by providing a workable way to reduce customer attrition and improve credit stability.
